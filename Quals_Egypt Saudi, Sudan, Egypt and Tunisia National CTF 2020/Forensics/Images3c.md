===================
>Securing an important image requires good encryption. so we added extra security layer for your photo and now is unbreakable!.

We got an jpg file.

It's an easy challenge so I try basics tools like **exiftool** and see **strings** but found nothing usefull.

So I decided to use **Steghide**.
 
passphrase was required so I use **Stegcracker** to make bruteforce.
